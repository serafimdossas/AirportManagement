# __Airport Network Management__

Project about _Airport Netwowrk Administration_

For example it uses a small sample of airports and some data about them. Every airport has its Code name, the city that is located at, the country it belongs and a list with airlines that use it.

The system also has a list with a sample of flights between two airports used in it.

Users can type a city of their preferences and the program will display the airport's data.
After that users can also insert a second city of their preferences and if this city exists in system data, a window with flights between the two cities will be displayed.
